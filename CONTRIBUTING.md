# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project!

## Current Development Stage

**Please Note: I am not currently accepting external contributions (Pull Requests or Issues) at this time.**

The project is in its infancy, core systems are still being actively developed and are subject to frequent & major changes. My primary focus is on stabilizing the foundational architecture.

## Future Collaboration

Enthusiasm is always appreciated! If you are interested in contributing once the core systems are stable and I officially open up for external collaboration, I'd love to hear from you.

**Please send an email to [vlindback@gmail.com]** with a brief note about your interest and relevant experience. We can discuss potential future involvement and keep you updated on the project's progress.

I anticipate opening up for contributions once the first alpha version is released.
