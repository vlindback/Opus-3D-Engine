1. Depending on your OS:
	- Windows:

		Install meson

		Install the vscode C/C++ extension by Microsoft.

		Run tools/setup.bat, if it reports any errors fix those.
	- Linux

2. Now you should be able to debug in the GUI (Run and Debug)
	- Simply select Game or Editor and debug.
	- If you want to build a specific version use Ctrl+Shift+B and then Build-Opus3D-Release/Debug
